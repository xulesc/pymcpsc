pyMCPSC README file
=====================

The pyMCPSC Project is a utility for performing large-scale Multi-criteria
Protein Structure Comparison (MCPSC) on a multi-core CPU with an easy to extend
API for adding and removing PSC methods. It makes use of several relevant python
tools to perform typical associated tasks.

This README file is intended primarily for people interested in working
with the source code.

This pyMCPSC package is open source software made available under generous
terms. Please see the LICENSE file for further details.
